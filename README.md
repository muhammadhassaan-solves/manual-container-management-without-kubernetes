<h1>Manual Container Management Without Orchestration</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved manually managing Docker containers. It helped me understand real-world challenges like scaling, health checks, and recovery without orchestration. I gained practical insights into the risks and extra work of manual management. This highlights why Kubernetesâ€™ automation, self-healing, and service discovery are essential for building reliable and scalable DevOps environments.

<br>For a detailed explanation of the challenges of manual container management and how Kubernetes solves them, see the [Why Orchestration?](https://github.com/muhammadhassaan-solves/manual-container-management-without-kubernetes/blob/main/why_orchestration.md) document in this repository.
